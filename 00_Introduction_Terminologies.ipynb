    "\n",
    ">1) Django's buit-in webserver **translates HTTP requests to python**. ```manage.py runserver``` targets **development** settings (e.g. by auto restarting on changes). \n",
    "\n",
    ">2) It can process only **one request at a time**. It is **not optmized to spawn multiple worker processes** to parallelize incoming requests to multiple cpu cores. (For this, we use **Gunicorn**) \n",
    "\n",
    ">3) They are **not optimized for handling concurrent request**. (For this we use **Nginx**)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4) The **Django skeleton website** created using the ```django-admin``` and ```manage.py``` tools are configured to make **development easier**. Many of the **Django project settings** (specified in settings.py) **should be different for production**, either for security or performance reasons."
